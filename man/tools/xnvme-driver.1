.SH NAME
\fBxnvme-driver \fP- unbind Kernel NVMe driver from devices and bind to vfio / uio
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
Allocate hugepages and bind NVMe, I/OAT, VMD and Virtio devices to a generic
VFIO kernel driver. If VFIO is not available on the system then UIO is used
as fall back.. NVMe and Virtio devices with active mountpoints will be
ignored. All hugepage operations use default hugepage size on the system
(hugepagesz).
.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B
config
Default mode. Allocate hugepages and bind PCI devices.
.TP
.B
reset
Rebind PCI devices back to their original drivers.
Hugepage memory size will remain unchanged.
.TP
.B
help
Print this help message.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

.TP
.B
HUGEMEM
Size of hugepage memory to allocate (in MB). 2048 by
default. For NUMA systems, the hugepages will be evenly
distributed between CPU nodes
.TP
.B
NRHUGE
Number of hugepages to allocate.
This variable overwrites HUGEMEM.
.TP
.B
HUGENODE
Specific NUMA node to allocate hugepages on. To allocate
hugepages on multiple nodes run this script once for each
node.
.TP
.B
PCI_BLACKLIST
See PCI_WHITELIST
.TP
.B
PCI_WHITELIST
Whitespace separated list of PCI devices (NVMe, I/OAT, VMD,
Virtio). Each device must be specified as a full PCI
address. E.g. PCI_WHITELIST="0000:01:00.0 0000:02:00.0" To
blacklist all PCI devices use a non-valid address. E.g.
PCI_WHITELIST="none" If PCI_WHITELIST and PCI_BLACKLIST are
empty or unset, all PCI devices will be bound. Each device
in PCI_BLACKLIST will be ignored (driver won't be changed).
PCI_BLACKLIST has precedence over PCI_WHITELIST.
.TP
.B
TARGET_USER
User that will own hugepage mountpoint directory and vfio
groups. By default the current user will be used.
.TP
.B
DRIVER_OVERRIDE
Disable automatic vfio-pci/uio_pci_generic selection and
forcefully bind devices to the given driver. E.g.
DRIVER_OVERRIDE=uio_pci_generic or
DRIVER_OVERRIDE=/home/public/dpdk/build/kmod/igb_uio.ko
